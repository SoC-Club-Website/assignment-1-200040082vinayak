This is Vinayak Mittal's SOC project.

I worked on the About Us Page of our final anime website. It involved coming up with important and attractive features about us and writing them all down. Also, apart from that, I believe I was instrumental in the ideating of our webpage. I helped come up with new and unique ideas to develop our website. 

Apart from that are also uploaded the intitial weekly assignments. A lot of them might seem missing as well since I used some of them directly in the final webpage for our project (eg. carousel) But I did learn the material provided to us each week and implemented it thoroughly.

The only problem I had was in recognizing the Login and SignUp feature which was taken up by my other team members, who were great to work with too.
